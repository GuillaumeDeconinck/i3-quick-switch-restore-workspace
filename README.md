# i3-quick-switch-restore-workspace

In summary, the goal was to have an easy way to switch workspaces in i3 (Manjaro) based on "workspace names". It used Rofi for displaying the workspaces' names and to do the fuzzy-matching.

It's kinda the same idea as Vim's buffers (except you don't chose the buffers' names as far as I know), but for i3's workspaces and using Rofi for UI.

I also wanted to store layouts so that you wouldn't have to redo your workspaces at each restart, but I never finished it.

The code is quick and dirty :wink:
